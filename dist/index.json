	"content": "\nAbout Log file in Kodi is a kodi.log file, located in temporary directory. Location of that directory depends on the platform, and even on the same platform it can differ. Locations can be discovered here: https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Advanced#Location\nPreparation First of all, log file, by default, contains only limited records, only errors or some notable actions, but, to understand the cause of an issue, we need full log. So we need to enable debugging in Kodi.\n Enter Kodi System settings  Enable Expert level of settings  Enable event logging  That is it! But you probably won\u0026rsquo;t like the onscreen information about CPU usage and so on. So you can create an advancedsettings.xml file in Kodi\u0026rsquo;s Userdata folder (https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata), which this content:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026quot;1.0\u0026quot; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;advancedsettings\u0026gt; \u0026lt;loglevel\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/loglevel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;debug\u0026gt; \u0026lt;extralogging\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/extralogging\u0026gt; \u0026lt;showloginfo\u0026gt;false\u0026lt;/showloginfo\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/debug\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/advancedsettings\u0026gt;  It will enable logging and hide onscreen information.\n Now your Kodi records everything into the log file!\n  What we have Elementum has few HTTP links which can give you more information about torrenting status, system information, some timers of common operations (which are way too useful for developers!): - /debug/bundle will give you all the debug information + kodi.log file included. So it\u0026rsquo;s the fullest log file, and is what we\u0026rsquo;d expect from you to find the problem. - /debug/all contains all the debug information, without kodi.log, so it\u0026rsquo;s all about the system and torrent engine, but not Kodi.\nTo find proper link: - Enter Elementum addon, open Status - In the table you can see the address, that can be opened from other devices (in case you Kodi runs on a separate device in the network) Two ways of taking a log file: Easy one If your Elementum starts fine, so you can enter it, browse for something, then you can try this way, if not, please, browse for the Hard one.\nThere is bundled functionality to upload your /debug/bundle or /debug/all logs to pastebin services. All you need is to enter settings and start an upload:\n Enter Elementum settings, open Advanced tab, browse to Logging section and you can see there are Upload options.  Now you get an url of a paste. Write it down and share in your issues!  Easy enough?!\nHard one Still not so hard, but, sadly, more manual and needs some effords, at least, for the first time. So you can follow the manual here: https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy\nShortly, you can install log uploader plugin, and run it to get pastebin link of an uploaded log file. Or you can find your log location here: https://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Advanced#Location and use it manually.\n"

	"content": "Update instructions. How it works Elementum has a self-hosted virtual Kodi repository. What it means?\n When installed, Elementum adds a repository to Kodi. In some cases it is added, but not enabled, so you can manually enable it like any other addon. Repository update address points to the Elementum addon, so it you Elementum cannot start - repository is not working. This was made in that way to be able to change repository source in the code, in case github in inaccessible, or something. Plugin knows which OS architecture it needs, so it\u0026rsquo;s downloading only that architecture zip file. Repository contains the Addon itself, Burst addon, Context addon, you can install or update any of them.   Please, don\u0026rsquo;t use third-party repositories to install or update the addon, unless you know they are providing you with the universal package, which contains all the architectures.\n So, if you addon works fine - you can simply update the addon as usually, or leave it to Kodi. If not, then you should re-download addon from Downloads and re-install from zip. No need to remove the addon before installing.\n"
